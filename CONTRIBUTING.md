## Contributing Code or Reviewing

We appreciate any contributions!

Contributions can be made by raising pull requests against the master
branch. If you are a new contributor, your pull request should also include adding your name and organisation 
to the list of contributors under the [Contributors](#contributors) part of this page.

A reviewer will then read through the pull request and suggest any alterations or approve the PR. This process must be 
done before a PR is merged with the master branch.
